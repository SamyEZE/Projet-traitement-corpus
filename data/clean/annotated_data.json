Our current understanding of why this paradigm is so effective is that it is equivalent to a manifold learning objective. Deep neural networks are universal approximators and we deliberately train them in a heavily over-parameterized regime: this means that we are making very few assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data which grants the model a lot of flexibility to discover an efficient representational basis space.

Really, the whole difference is that PCA just has a single linear layer whereas  an autoencoder has multiple layers with activation functions that let it learn nonlinear relationships. \n\nMost other types of subspace embeddings reference autoencoder literature, so you can use that as the jumping off point. \n\nHow I like to think about it (computer vision background) is that autoencoders care about improving reconstruction accuracy in *pixel space* meaning you just get the difference between each pixel in each image and get the MSE and that's the loss you're minimizing. Kinda makes sense initially, but when you dig into it you'll realize that the exact same image just shifted 10 pixels to the right has a terrible reconstruction accuracy even though semantically it is almost the exact same image. The result of this is that autoencoders tend to make really blurry reconstructions because the loss will be less impacted by a few pixel shifts in any direction. \n\nMost of the moves from there have been to change the objective to something we care about more than just raw pixel space accuracy. Where autoencoders just try to recreate the image in pixel space, GANs try to create an image that looks like it comes from the training distribution (i.e. it should be realistic and not blurry). Things like BYOL\/SimCLR use a different objective saying that the neural network should create a latent space that is invariant to image augmentation, so you pass in the same image twice but with different rotations\/scales\/cropping\/etc and tell the neural network it should create the same embedding both times. PixelRNN tries to condition each pixel on the previous pixels, i.e. a guess the next pixel game, which works kinda similarly to generative pre training. Lots of different objectives you can care about here depending on what you care about.","category":"general_qa","text_length":1907,"word_count":314,"entities":[["PCA","ORG"],["Kinda","PERSON"],["10","CARDINAL"],["BYOL\/SimCLR","ORG"]]}

The way it works is - it's running a prefix scan, one for queries and one for keys, so the model \"feels\" the order of a sequence. The prefix scan alone doesn't work that well, but it turns out you just have to normalize the resulting vector. You could try dividing the vector by its magnitude, but then you lose the magnitude information which is quite important for calculating attention scores. Thus I settled on dividing by the square root of the vector's magnitude. Seems to work pretty well. Getting lower perplexity than RoPE or ALiBi and it can extrapolate without any modifications to longer sequences than seen during training. No hyperparameters to tune other than how many channels to use for positional encoding per head - but I just fixed it to \"half\" of the channels.","category":"misc","text_length":877,"word_count":154,"entities":[["half","CARDINAL"],["RoPE","GPE"],["ALiBi","ORG"],["half","CARDINAL"]]}

There are multiple different factors contributing to this fact. I can think of some off the top of my head. \n\nBut first the authors have their rights to not go opensource. They are required to show the validity of their work. Let's say you have a picture of the swan. Can you convince another person that without full disclosure? Probably, if you give them a peek through a reasonably sized hole. The code does not need to be included within the hole all the time.\n\nSecond is fairness. Many big tech companies get away with their publication without full disclosure of their training data or model. For example, google with attention all you need paper. ViT was actually much worse than CNNs without google's propietary data, JFT-3B. They claimed that ViT gets much better performance on ImageNet, *only if* it's trained on JFT-3B. How could reviewer replicate this work? Not only it would have taken 10+ years for ordinary researcher to train ViT-XL\/16 on 3 billion images with a 1080ti (releaesed in 2017), but also they don't have access to that data. Nonetheless, it got published (NIPS). It wouldn't be fair to reject some random scholar's work because of lack of code \/ data, but accept big tech's work regardless.\n\nThrid thing is this: I can tell you though even if the codes are posted by the authors, they don't work majority of the time. And replicating the result is another story. Nonetheless, they get published. Why? Because reviewers are not given enough resources. They are asked to review the *paper* not the *work*. Reviewers shouldn't invest their own resources for validating, because well there is no compensation. It requires substantial amount of the time which is apparently the most important resouce for researchers bc they dont have money to save their time. \n\nSolution to this problem is complicated. But it is obvious that reviewer's time must be valued. I strongly think all reviews should be paid.","category":"general_qa","text_length":1944,"word_count":329,"entities":[["Second","ORDINAL"],["ViT","ORG"],["google","ORG"],["ViT","ORG"],["ImageNet","ORG"],["10+ years","DATE"],["3 billion","CARDINAL"],["2017","DATE"],["Thrid","PERSON"]]}

It means they have enough information to do the same experiment. \n\nIf you have a significant disagreement, then you get into the weeds of specific hardware and software.\n\nSo you publish an algorithm or a method of acquiring a dataset.  Someone else should be able to write their own implementation of your algorithm to verify it, or gather data using the same process. They will get different results but they should be statistically similar, and if they aren't then there is a problem and that becomes a discussion. \n\nIn other fields, say physics, you describe the hardware you use and what it does, but you don't just have other people run the experiment in your lab.  They can use their own apparatus that does the same basic thing (a laser with the same power and frequency for example) In psych you might publish the questions asked in a survey and the overall result but not the raw data from the survey and not the web form used to ask the questions.","category":"general_qa","text_length":1020,"word_count":181,"entities":[]}

Providing a source code is entirely different from working with a live\/trained model. Even if you have the source code, your model would be different based on the data used to train it.

We're talking about big companies. And they are all about making money, simple as that. And making money also involves marketing, look at a few tricks we see:\n\n1. Some leaders in these companies say \"Oh, science needs to be open\", but we go check their published papers, 90% without code and not thoroughly developed.\n\n2. More published papers means a signal you're a \"big player\" which means more money from investors to buy 1M GPUs. Regardless of the quality of said paper. Making code reproducible means formatting and following some good practices so others can use, since this time could be spent producing more signaling papers, they just won't do it.\n\nIn addition, no one is checking, because lo' and behold the same \"leaders\"  inside the companies are part of the reviewing committee on conferences who actually have the power to enforce rules. But the question is, why would they shoot themselves in the foot?\n\nThe reasoning for companies and leaders is easy to understand. What I personally struggle to understand is the student\/researcher who actually repeat, or worse, believe in these arguments. Things are so upside down nowadays that is common to see researchers saying: \"Oh, code is not that important, a well written paper is enough. \" Or \"Why should I run statistical tests to prove hypothesis, they also have their shortcomings\". Just absolute nonsense.\n\nA more honest reasoning would be: \"I am a researcher, I need to publish something regardless, I'll jump some hoops to make it fast otherwise someone will publish it. \" That is more acceptable. But going out in the open AGAINST 100% clean code, and AGAINST hypothesis testing it is just plain stupidity. \n\nAnd finally, since nobody seems to care because in the end of the day everyone just wants a piece of the pie, the naive researcher who actually wants to reproduce and compare things is utterly f****, because the mentality in ML is 100% against that.","category":"general_qa","text_length":2060,"word_count":349,"entities":[["Today","DATE"],["AI","GPE"],["1","CARDINAL"],["90%","PERCENT"],["2","CARDINAL"],["1M","CARDINAL"],["100%","PERCENT"],["the end of the day","DATE"],["ML","GPE"],["100%","PERCENT"]]}

We see how precarious the situation is when we have to sit down with researchers and discuss the importance of reproducibility in science. Non reproducible data, code, experiments only create mysticism. \"Attention is all you need\" just to 3 years later a MLP architecture reproduce almost the same performance with less parameters. We're walking in circles and people still want to defend this regime.\n\nTo be honest, a more realistic approach would be: Create a new journal, conference where the rule of the game is reproducibility 100%. There are a few journals in Statistics where each paper is associated with a 100% working, well developed package. Then we have to line up a few big names to champion that and start playing the game \"Oh, you only published at ICML\/Neurips? I'm sorry, good idea, but since it isn't reproducible it's not good enough. \" Then the division is made: Those who want to meaningfully research things go to X, those who want to advertise their papers (while secretly wishing to make a start up out of it) go to Y.\n\nIt's way too much noise...","category":"general_qa","text_length":1079,"word_count":186,"entities":[["3 years later","DATE"],["100%","PERCENT"],["Statistics","GPE"],["100%","PERCENT"],["ICML\/Neurips","ORG"]]}

In robotics, neuromorphic hardware for event-based vision and spiking neural networks promises to exhibit similar characteristics. However, robotic implementations have been limited to basic tasks with low-dimensional sensory inputs and motor actions because of the restricted network size in current embedded neuromorphic processors and the difficulties of training spiking neural networks. Here, we present a fully neuromorphic vision-to-control pipeline for controlling a flying drone. Specifically, we trained a spiking neural network that accepts raw event-based camera data and outputs low-level control actions for performing autonomous vision-based flight. The vision part of the network, consisting of five layers and 28,800 neurons, maps incoming raw events to ego-motion estimates and was trained with self-supervised learning on real event data. The control part consists of a single decoding layer and was learned with an evolutionary algorithm in a drone simulator. Robotic experiments show a successful sim-to-real transfer of the fully learned neuromorphic pipeline. The drone could accurately control its ego-motion, allowing for hovering, landing, and maneuvering sideways\u2014even while yawing at the same time. The neuromorphic pipeline runs on board on Intel\u2019s Loihi neuromorphic processor with an execution frequency of 200 hertz, consuming 0.94 watt of idle power and a mere additional 7 to 12 milliwatts when running the network.

This sampling error is part of why we don't care about the gap, only the direction of change.\n\nAnother reason we don't care about that gap is we don't actually know if these losses are being calculated on the same scale. Depending on what the training objective is, it's entirely possible that the loss scales inversely with the number of observations used to compute it, in which case we would *expect* the validation loss to be higher than the training loss under learning dynamics demonstrating good generalizability.\n\nOutliers also have higher leverage when data is small.

By that way of thinking you could take any representation and any model that uses it, apply any arbitrary invertible transformation to both the representation and the input of the model using it, and thus get something that would be an \"encoding\" to someone who does not have the transformed model but, at the same time, would be a \"representation\" to someone who does have the transformed model. I think the fact that this distinction is relative means that it does not capture any fundamental truths about what is going on.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd even so, diffusion model encodings\/representations\/etc are not inherently useless - the original denoising diffusion model shows that you can use them for latent space interpolation, and that they form a kind of progressive encoding as a function of time, which strongly suggests that meaningful semantic information is being captured. Other papers have shown that semantic information is indeed captured by flow models.\u00a0\n\n\nThe fact that you also need the drift model in order to interpret the flow's encoding\/representation\/etc in a useful way does not seem like an important distinction to me, in light of the above-described relativity of the thing.","category":"misc","text_length":1455,"word_count":238,"entities":[]}

The problem is not that we are making assumptions -- I agree we need to make some assumption -- the problem is that the uncertainty assigned by conformal prediction may not reliably increase for new datapoints distant from the training set.\n\nWe'd really like the behavior that we can get from a Gaussian process with a stationary kernel and appropriate hyperparameter settings, like this (to pick a somewhat random example): [https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Florent-Leclercq\/publication\/327613136\/figure\/fig1\/AS:749406701776896@1555683889137\/Illustration-of-Gaussian-process-regression-in-one-dimension-for-the-target-test.png](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Florent-Leclercq\/publication\/327613136\/figure\/fig1\/AS:749406701776896@1555683889137\/Illustration-of-Gaussian-process-regression-in-one-dimension-for-the-target-test.png) Notice that as we move away from the data we've already seen, our uncertainty increases. Linear regression will also do this (Bayesian linear regression is of course just a GP with a linear kernel). Conformal prediction is not guaranteed to do this.\n\nThis picture is of course a little simplistic because in 1d it is easy to say \"this datapoint is distant from the training set\", but not so easy when dealing with say images where \"distant from the training set\" may be harder to quantify. Of course, if we think of the neural net as mapping from an input (say an image) to a feature vector where the last layer uses the feature vector to make a prediction, we could say \"distant in the feature space that the NN maps the input into\", but \"distant\" in this space may not necessarily correspond to \"distant\" in the input space, so this doesn't necessarily simplify the problem as much as we might like.\n\nWe could of course use some other method to try to detect when data is out of distribution or OOD and if it *is* OOD notify the user rather than trying to estimate our uncertainty using conformal prediction, which may be misleading. OP seems to want to use an uncertainty quantitation method for which uncertainty is guaranteed to be high for OOD data however.  \n  \nThere are a variety of methods proposed in the literature, I'm not familiar enough with all of them to be able to say for sure which is \"the best\" -- might need to do some careful benchmarking. One example is the SNGP method from this paper [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.10108](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.10108) which in fact just replaces the last layer of the neural net with a random Fourier features approximated GP, and uses spectral normalization on layer weights to try to ensure the mapping represented by the neural net is distance preserving.","category":"general_qa","text_length":2783,"word_count":405,"entities":[["Gaussian","NORP"],["Linear","ORG"],["Bayesian","NORP"],["GP","ORG"],["1d","CARDINAL"],["NN","ORG"],["One","CARDINAL"],["SNGP","ORG"],["Fourier","PERSON"],["GP","ORG"]]}

This is more about your statement seems to imply that only conformal methods suffer from domain \/ distributional shift issues. Most off-the-shelf vanilla methods have this problem and assessing the severity on your setting is an empirical exercise. You rightly note that there are some flavors of conformal prediction try to deal with this problem but discount them. Similarly you bring up using GPs; however applying GPs to quantify uncertainty in NNs is going to be non-trivial and your admonition about not being sure about how it will work still applies. I spent a lot of time on a project to quantify uncertainty in NNs and there are no panaceas.","category":"general_qa","text_length":689,"word_count":115,"entities":[]}

In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems.

'Just' train a encoder tokenizer for each modality, maybe define some of the extra 100k BPEs as modality-specific delimiters similar to delimiting prompts\/end-of-text tokens - and then it's just 'tokenize all the things' as long interleaved sequences like iGPT\/DALL-E 1, Gato, CM3, or Gemini; and train normally at scale. Then every kind of paired data just falls out naturally, all of the few-shot or zero-shot, all of the editing, and so on, and you just keep adding in whatever new modality or metadata you need to.\n\nThis also could potentially get you the low-latency they are showing off: you aren't running a diffusion model for iterations over the entire output before you can ship it off to the waiting user, you are spitting out a few tokens encoding the final modality (skipping all of the older multi-stage pipelines), which can start serially going through the upscaler\/decoder's single forward pass and stream out to the user immediately.\n\n(It also means that it's easy to provide new ways of formatting or reprocessing data cleanly. Just define it as a new 'modality'. For example, you could keep BPEs at runtime, with the context window benefits, but you could then also provide a 'character\/byte-tokenized modality' which is the same text, just using only the byte-level BPEs; and then train on both forms of text occasionally, like a translation task.

{"instruction":"[D] Full causal self-attention layer in O(NlogN) computation steps and O(logN) time rather than O(N^2) computation steps and O(1) time, with a big caveat, but hope for the future.","context":"\\*Update\\*: Actually O(N) computation steps(not O(Nlog N)) and O(log N) time.\n\nI think I figured out how to do self-attention in transformer models in O(NlogN) computation steps rather than O(N\\^2), with a caveat. I'm not trying to be an academic, so I don't care to publish this formally, but I thought that some people might be interested. My construction is not efficient or practical, but the fact that it can be done at all might motivate further work to find efficient alternatives.\n\ntl;dr Use the parallel scan\\[1\\] technique to compute taylor series basis functions needed to compute the causal self-attention layer and sum these together weighted by the values vector and 1 to get the numerator and denominator of the softmax activation of the full causal self-attention layer. The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed.

The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed.

The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation.

The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\].

It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative.

The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation.

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax.

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\]. That means that causal self-attention can be calculated with O(log N) time and O(N) steps instead of O(NlogN) steps.\n\n# Update 2\n\n@[Lajamerr\\_Mittesdine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Lajamerr_Mittesdine\/) Started some code to implement the algorithm in a comment below. I made some changes to it, and the result is below. Thanks @[Lajamerr\\_Mittesdine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Lajamerr_Mittesdine\/)! Also, I want to reiterate that this is not meant to be an efficient or practical implementation of the self-attention. Each taylor series basis function takes logN time and NlogN computation, but you would need a lot of basis functions to properly approximate the softmax of attention scores. Alternatively, the algorithm can be ran in recursive mode, which turns it into an RNN that runs in O(N) steps. This is more to show that self-attention can be implemented as many RNNs running in parallel. To make this efficient, a different formula for self-attention would have to be used, not the softmax of the dot product of queries and keys, but something else that can be computed with few parallel scans.\n\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # note, there is a slighlty more efficient algorithm for partial sums that computes in O(log(N)) time and O(N) computation.

Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique.

The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation.

The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation.

This is more to show that self-attention can be implemented as many RNNs running in parallel. To make this efficient, a different formula for self-attention would have to be used, not the softmax of the dot product of queries and keys, but something else that can be computed with few parallel scans.\n\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # note, there is a slighlty more efficient algorithm for partial sums that computes in O(log(N)) time and O(N) computation.

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation.

The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique.

Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function.

Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN.

Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique.

Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

My construction is not efficient or practical, but the fact that it can be done at all might motivate further work to find efficient alternatives.\n\ntl;dr Use the parallel scan\\[1\\] technique to compute taylor series basis functions needed to compute the causal self-attention layer and sum these together weighted by the values vector and 1 to get the numerator and denominator of the softmax activation of the full causal self-attention layer. The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

Partial sums can be computed in O(logN) time and O(N) computation.","category":"misc","text_length":521,"word_count":94,"entities":[["taylor","PERSON"],["O(logN","ORG"]]}

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\].

I'm not trying to be an academic, so I don't care to publish this formally, but I thought that some people might be interested. My construction is not efficient or practical, but the fact that it can be done at all might motivate further work to find efficient alternatives.\n\ntl;dr Use the parallel scan\\[1\\] technique to compute taylor series basis functions needed to compute the causal self-attention layer and sum these together weighted by the values vector and 1 to get the numerator and denominator of the softmax activation of the full causal self-attention layer. The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\\\sum\\_{i=0}\\^{j-1} k(i)\\_a\\^n q(j)\\_b\\^m$. k(i)\\_a\\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\\_b\\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \\* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.\n\n# Background\n\nI was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\\[2\\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, a\\_3, a\\_4, ...\\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\\_i to a\\_{i -1}, where a\\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_2 + a\\_3, ...\\], and compute r\\_i + r\\_{i-2}, which gives \\[a\\_1, a\\_1+a\\_2, a\\_1+a\\_2+a\\_3, ...\\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\\_i + r\\_{i-2\\*\\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\\*\\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.\n\n# The Meat of It\n\nIn the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.\n\nLet's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\\_length, embedding\\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\\[y\\[0,:\\], y\\[0,:\\]+y\\[1,:\\], ...\\]. Now multiply the result by q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v).\n\nWhat is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\\\cdot k$ in place of $q\\[:,j,:\\] \\\\cdot k\\[:,i,:\\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\\\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\\\cdot k) + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*2 \/ 2! + ... + (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/ n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\\\cdot k)\\*\\*n \/n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} x\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((x\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:\n\n$$  \n(\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)\\*v)) \/ (\\\\sum\\_{n, m} A\\_{n, m} q\\[:,j\\]\\*\\*m \\* ParallelPartialSum((k\\[:,i\\]\\*\\*n)))  \n$$\n\nWhere again, A\\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\\\cdot k).\n\n# Take-Aways\n\nOne big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.\n\nNon-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix\\_sum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prefix_sum)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.00752)\n\n# Update\n\nActually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\\[1\\]. That means that causal self-attention can be calculated with O(log N) time and O(N) steps instead of O(NlogN) steps.\n\n# Update 2\n\n@[Lajamerr\\_Mittesdine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Lajamerr_Mittesdine\/) Started some code to implement the algorithm in a comment below. I made some changes to it, and the result is below. Thanks @[Lajamerr\\_Mittesdine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Lajamerr_Mittesdine\/)! Also, I want to reiterate that this is not meant to be an efficient or practical implementation of the self-attention.

Recent studies have suggested that Transformers can implement first-order optimization algorithms for in-context learning and even second order ones for the case of linear regression. In this work, we study whether Transformers can perform higher order optimization methods, beyond the case of linear regression. We establish that linear attention Transformers with ReLU layers can approximate second order optimization algorithms for the task of logistic regression and achieve \u03f5 error with only a logarithmic to the error more layers. As a by-product we demonstrate the ability of even linear attention-only Transformers in implementing a single step of Newton's iteration for matrix inversion with merely two layers. These results suggest the ability of the Transformer architecture to implement complex algorithms, beyond gradient descent.","response":"Well this sounds like anyone can make linear regression by the linear regressions.

LinearBoost is based on boosting a linear classifier to significantly enhance performance. Our testing shows it outperforms traditional GBDT algorithms in terms of accuracy and response time across five well-known datasets.  \nThe key to LinearBoost's enhanced performance lies in its approach at each estimator stage. Unlike decision trees used in GBDTs, which select features sequentially, LinearBoost utilizes a linear classifier as its building block, considering all available features simultaneously. This comprehensive feature integration allows for more robust decision-making processes at every step.\n\nWe believe LinearBoost can be a valuable tool for both academic research and real-world applications. Check out our results and code in our GitHub repo:\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/LinearBoost\/linearboost-classifier](https:\/\/github.com\/LinearBoost\/linearboost-classifier) .

Those are only 5 datasets. For evaluating tabular classifiers, you should use tens of datasets, they are readily available. Also, describe evaluation procedure, e.g. use 5-fold CV for testing. See e.g. \"A novel selective na\u00efve Bayes algorithm\" Chen et al., which use 65 datasets.\n2. You must compare to XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost on large-scale datasets from their respective papers. Especially since scalability and speed is one of your selling points. If you aimed specifically at boosting for small data, then you don't need this, but it isn't stated anywhere.\n3. One of major advantages of XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost is being able to use custom loss functions. This allowed them to be easily used e.g. for ranking. If you don't support this, you should explicitly state this limitation.\n4. Number of estimators is just a hyperparameter, why show large tables with this? Just present the best result for each dataset.\n5. Your implementation doesn't support class weights, as far as I can tell. This is a huge limitation, since almost all datasets are imbalanced, often heavily.\n6. You must not embed scalers inside your code. You can destroy data sparsity, affect categorical variables, and do other stuff outside user's control this way. Add checks and throw exceptions if you absolutely require this.\n7. You only support numerical data, in constrast to LightGBM or CatBoost. You should highlight this limitation.\n8. This works only for classification, not even regression. This is, again, a huge limitation, but probably can be fixed, as far as I can tell.\n\nEDIT:\n\n9.

Your training objective should then be the following: given the last n timesteps at location A, predict the number of check-ins for each of the next k time steps at location A.

There's a good library that does it here: https:\/\/github.com\/atong01\/conditional-flow-matching\n\nWith flow matching you use differential equation solvers explicitly, which means that it's easy to run the generative model both forwards and backwards in time.\n\nEDIT: If you do diffusion in a latent space by mapping data samples x to some latent space using a VAE, then the model isn't totally invertible because the VAE isn't invertible.

{"instruction":"[D] Thoughts on DSPy","context":"I have been tinkering with DSPy and thought I will share my 2 cents here for anyone who is planning to explore it:\n\nThe core idea behind DSPy are two things:\n\n1.\t\u2060Separate programming from prompting\n2.\t\u2060incorporate some of the best practice prompting techniques under the hood and expose it as a \u201csignature\u201d\n\nImagine working on a RAG. Today, the typical approach is to write some retrieval and pass the results to a language model for natural language generation. But, after the first pass, you realize it\u2019s not perfect and you need to iterate and improve it. Typically, there are 2 levers to pull:\n\n1.\t\u2060Document Chunking, insertion and Retrieval strategy\n2.\t\u2060Language model settings and prompt engineering\n\nNow, you try a few things, maybe document the performance in a google sheet, iterate and arrive at an ideal set of variables that gives max accuracy.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say after a month, model upgrades, and all of a sudden the accuracy of your RAG regresses. Again you are back to square one, cos you don\u2019t know what to optimize now - retrieval or model? You see what the problem is with this approach? This is a very open ended, monolithic, brittle and unstructured way to optimize and build language model based applications.\n\nThis is precisely the problem DSPy is trying to solve. Whatever you can achieve with DSPy can be achieved with native prompt engineering and program composition techniques but it is purely dependent on the programmers skill. But DSPy provides native constructs which anyone can learn and use for trying different techniques in a systematic manner.\n\nDSPy the concept:\n\nSeparate prompting from programming and signatures\n\nDSPy does not do any magic with the language model. It just uses a bunch of prompt templates behind the scenes and exposes them as signatures. Ex: when you write a signature like \u2018context, question -> answer\u2019, DSPy adds a typical RAG prompt before it makes the call to the LLM. But DSPy also gives you nice features like module settings, assertion based backtracking and automatic prompt optimization.\n\nBasically, you can do something like this with DSPy,\n\n\u201cGiven a context and question, answer the following question. Make sure the answer is only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\u201d. If the language model responds with anything else, traditionally we prompt engineer our way to fix it. In DSPy, you can assert the answer for \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and if the assertion fails, DSPy will backtrack automatically, update the prompt to say something like, \u201cthis is not a correct answer- {previous_answer} and always only respond with a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\u201d and makes another language model call which improves the LLMs response because of this newly optimized prompt. In addition, you can also incorporate things like multi hops in your retrieval where you can do something like \u201cretrieve -> generate queries and then retrieve again using the generated queries\u201d for n times and build up a larger context to answer the original question.\n\nObviously, this can also be done using usual prompt engineering and programming techniques, but the framework exposes native easy to use settings and constructs to do these things more naturally. DSPy as a concept really shines when you are composing a pipeline of language model calls where prompt engineering the entire pipeline or even module wise can lead to a brittle Pipeline.\n\nDSPy the Framework:\n\nNow coming to the framework which is built in python, I think the framework as it stands today is\n\n1.\t\u2060Not production ready\n2.\t\u2060Lacks clear documentation\n3.\t\u2060Poorly designed with not so clean interfaces and abstractions\n\nTo me it felt like a rushed implementation with little thought for design thinking, testing and programming principles. The framework code is very hard to understand with a lot of meta programming and data structure parsing and construction going behind the scenes that are scary to run in production.\n\nThis is a huge deterrent for anyone trying to learn and use this framework. But, I am sure the creators are thinking about all this and are working to reengineer the framework. There\u2019s also a typescript implementation of this framework that is fairly less popular but has a much better and cleaner design and codebase:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/dosco\/llm-client\/\n\nMy final thought about this framework is, it\u2019s a promising concept, but it does not change anything about what we already know about LLMs. Also, hiding prompts as templates does not mean prompt engineering is going away, someone still needs to \u201cengineer\u201d the prompts the framework uses and imo the framework should expose these templates and give control back to the developers that way, the vision of separate programming and prompting co exists with giving control not only to program but also to prompt.\n\nFinally, I was able to understand all this by running DSPy programs and visualizing the LLM calls and what prompts it\u2019s adding using my open source tool - https:\/\/github.com\/Scale3-Labs\/langtrace . Do check it out and let me know if you have any feedback.","response":"Nice write up. I did a presentation on DSPy for my coworkers a while back. It is very interesting.\n\n\nEdit:\nI kind of understand your criticism of the documentation, however, it is a product of a The\u00a0 Stanford NLP lab, which is impressive for how much the grad students have done on it.

However, as the article mentions, supercomputers are more likely to experience ill effects from cosmic radiation given their much larger surface area.\n\nAs an administrator of several such systems, I can say that the errors that result from such radiation are either virtually non-existent, or impossible to discern. Hypothetically, if one did occur, it would likely manifest as a bit flip on a specific piece of hardware.\n\nIf the bit flip occurred in RAM, for example, it could register as an ECC error, which may or may not cause a kernel panic. If the node panics, your training job would fail and requeue, with the node being set to `down` in whichever scheduler you use. Your team would go through running diagnostics on the node, they would all pass, and you would return the node to the production queue, unable to replicate the issue.\n\nIt is far more likely that training performance will suffer from a piece of hardware that fails due to a manufacturer defect than from cosmic radiation. Eg, that ECC error you just experienced is much more likely a bad DIMM than a bit flip from space.\n\nThat being said, due to the recency of the solar storm, this was actually a topic of conversation that was brought up, albeit in jest, during a couple calls and threads at work.

Any open-source project that tries to compete with Devin is welcome! Thank you for open-sourcing this. It looks simple to use and efficient! It has some issues understanding the whole codebase before making pull requests (for example, missing to see that there was already a functionality leveraging numpy and ending up reimplementing it), but this is easily solvable by using some context extension method or an RAG and adding a preprocessing phase to extract some metadata about the various parts of the project source. I'm sure you are going to handle this, and I will check the repo on GitHub often to give you feedback. Good luck! \n\nA humble suggestion: you should call it Darvin or Derwin, not Darwin.

Think about it like this, if I gave you two distributions that are highly similar, your equation would output a very large positive number. But how far is that number from absolute similarity?

The main goal of UAI is to develop a mathematical theory for combining sequential prediction (which seeks to predict the distribution of the next observation) together with action (which seeks to maximize expected reward), since these are among the problems that intelligent agents face when interacting in an unknown environment. Solomonoff induction provides a universal approach to sequence prediction in that it constructs an optimal prior (in a certain sense) over the space of all computable distributions of sequences, thus enabling Bayesian updating to enable convergence to the true predictive distribution (assuming the latter is computable).

And for that reason I think that \"non computable\" is bad terminology given its definition, because colloquially it does seem to imply that a non computable function literally cannot ever be evaluated, which isn't true.\n\nLike, sure, the halting problem is non computable, but you always have the option of letting a program run until it stops, and sometimes it does indeed stop. You just can't know that it will beforehand, and (in general) you also can't know how close you are to a stopping point.\n\nIf I had my way we'd replace \"non computable\" with \"non approximable\", because that gives a very concrete and correct colloquial understanding of the meaning of the thing.","category":"misc","text_length":879,"word_count":148,"entities":[]}

Imo the best thing to do is to do a parameter sweep for each method on a validation set and pick the best performing one. However, that is obviously very expensive. So I think just citing results from the other papers with their schedules (even if they are different) is probably still better than just forcing all methods to use the same one. Obviously there are caveats to that as well, for example for pre-training running more epochs is often better and comparing a 90 to a 300 epoch schedule isn't fair either, but if one method works better with slightly bigger LR and another one with smaller LR it doesn't really make sense to compare them with one uniform setup either.","category":"misc","text_length":992,"word_count":182,"entities":[["first","ORDINAL"],["90","CARDINAL"],["300","CARDINAL"],["one","CARDINAL"],["LR","ORG"],["LR","ORG"],["one","CARDINAL"]]}
